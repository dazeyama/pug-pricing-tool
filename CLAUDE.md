# PUG Pricing Tool — rules for Claude Code

- The spec is docs/DESIGN_SPEC.md. Read the relevant sections before each task. Update it
  when the owner changes a decision.
- Work only in C:\ClaudeProjects\pug-pricing-tool. collection-manager and audit-tool are
  READ-ONLY references: never edit, move or commit anything in them.
- One phase at a time (spec Section 15). Don't start the next phase until the owner reports back.
- Don't add settings, features or dependencies beyond the spec without asking the owner
  first. New settings ideas are welcome: propose them, don't just build them.
- Commit when a phase or fix is done. NEVER push unless the owner explicitly asks. Pushing
  to main deploys the live site.
- Never put API keys, the Supabase secret key (sb_secret_…), customer data or CSV files in the repo,
  code, docs or commit messages. Never commit "PUG Pricing Tool.txt" (contains a live key).
- Database changes are new migration files; apply to the dev project only unless told otherwise.
- The owner is QA — see memory `user-is-qa`.
- Current phase: 5
